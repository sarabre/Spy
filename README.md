# Spy
This Android game is based on Spy gameboard but with the difference that you can customize the list of words or add your own. I used SQL and Unity for coding this game.  You have to discover the word or find the spy when it's your turn.


Use WAMP to run a local server (localhost) and place www/*.php files on your computer. Import spy-db in your database so you can use public words.
Do not forget to change the URL in WordGroupController.cs if you change your path, which you definitely should do.
